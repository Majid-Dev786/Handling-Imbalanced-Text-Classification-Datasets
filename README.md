# Handling Imbalanced Text Classification Datasets

## Project Overview

This project presents a Python script for addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets in text classification tasks. 

Utilizing the 20 Newsgroups dataset, it showcases how to implement a TensorFlow model to classify text data effectively, even when the class distribution is uneven. 

The script demonstrates data preprocessing, model creation, and the utilization of class weights to balance the dataset influence across all categories.

## About The Project

The script leverages TensorFlow and the Sklearn library to preprocess text data from the 20 Newsgroups dataset, including tokenization and padding, before training a neural network model. 

The core of this project lies in its approach to handling imbalanced datasets through the calculation of class weights, which are then applied to the model training process to ensure fair representation of all classes.

## Getting Started

To use this script for your text classification tasks, follow the instructions under [Installation](#installation). 

Ensure you meet all [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) before proceeding.

## Usage

This script can be utilized in real-world scenarios where text data is unevenly distributed across different categories. Examples include:
- Sentiment analysis where some sentiments are more common than others.
- Email classification where certain types of emails are less frequent.
- Any text classification task requiring balanced representation from an imbalanced dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before installing and running this script, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.6 or later.
- TensorFlow installed in your Python environment.
- Sklearn for loading and splitting the dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Handling-Imbalanced-Text-Classification-Datasets.git
```
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn
```
4. Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
```bash
python script_name.py
```
Replace `Handling Imbalanced Text Classification Datasets.py` with the name of the script file you have saved in your project directory.
